# Shrubbery

**An online Python environment based on Skulpt, for teaching programming.**

Shrubbery aims to solve the problem of having to setup any sort of environment
on shared computers for teaching programming. Instead, it uses Skulpt to provide 
an in-browser Python interpreter and CodeMirror to provide a text editor.

It really is just a prettier (and easier to use) version of the Skulpt example
code.

## Try it
